# NSA Out of Academia

## To Do
### Dev Work
* make email links "mail to"
* suggested letters
* looks like Sunlight Foundation's API for state legislators by zipcode doesn't exit
* meaning creating a "contact your legislators" item to load onclick doesn't make much sense
* load by default only school's titles, and open for information onclick
* up and down arrows gui on side of panel for opening and closing schools
* padding between wells
* customize bootstrap
* make the search work-- jquery autocomplete makes school panels appear and disappear
* writing: homepage explanation, about page, gravatar
* custom 404?

### Deployment
* move to MySQL
* collecting static files
* hide secret key and debugmode off
* set dns with digital ocean
* set up cloudflare free level... cdn? scraping protection?
* robots.txt
* Piwik
* have dbondcc up

### Pipe Dreams
* Email directly from the page with modals
* Know who your elected officials are
